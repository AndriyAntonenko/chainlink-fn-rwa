# RWAs

Experiments and tries to build some RWAs.

## dTSLA (created by example from [PatrickAlphaC](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/rwa-creator))

1. Only the owner can mint dTSLA
2. Anyone can redeem dTSLA for USDC or "the stablecoin" of choice.
3. Chainlink functions will kick off a TSLA sell for USDC, and then send it to the contract
4. The user will have to then call finishRedeem to get their USDC.
